    <h1><strong>Rocks and Precious stones</strong></h1>
    <p><center>Rocks are found on the top most layer of the earth crust.They are formed by the wethering of soil deposits under
    the sea or as  a result of the cooling down of volcanic eruptions</center></p>
    There are three types of rock namely:
    <ul>
        <li>Igneous Rocks</li>
        <li>Metarmophic Rocks</li>
        <li>Sedimentary Rocks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Ignoeus Rocks</strong></h2>
    <a>Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling down of magma(magma is a hot a liquid that comes from the earth's crust and soldifies when cool)</a>

    <center>Above is an example of an Igneous rock</center>
    <h2>Sedimentary Rocks</h2>
    Sedimentary are formed by deposits of sand,rocks and other waste materials that have decomposed into layers of rock over the time.
    Sedimentary rocks appear to have layers and flakes these is as a results of the continous squeezing and composition of waste materials,sand and rocks.

    <h2>Metamophic Rocks</h2>
    Metamorphic are formed as a result of the heatin snd squeezing of existing rocks until they metamorphose or change into a new kind of rock.

    <p align="left">There are different types of metamorphic rocks such as:quartzite,slate,gnesis,marble,schist,hornfels and phyllite.</p>
